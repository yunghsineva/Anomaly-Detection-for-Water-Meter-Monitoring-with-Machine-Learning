## Anomaly Detection for Water Meter Monitoring with Machine Learning

### Project Overview

The research aim is to effectively identify and predict unusual household water usage patterns on a daily and weekly basis using machine learning algorithms.
Different from existing knowledge, the novelty of the hybrid model in this paper is its ability to combine supervised and unsupervised learning methods. It improves both
accuracy and efficiency compared to solely unsupervised or supervised models.

### Objectives

Building a hybrid model, which combines the advantages of supervised and unsupervised methods, using unsupervised learning to identify leakage features and building a supervised model to conduct prediction on time-series meter data.


### Methodology

1. **DATA COLLECTION**  
- Six months of 2016 were extracted from HELIX (open-source)
- The sample included 10% of consumers (around 100 users).
- 361,712 readings of hourly household water consumption.

2. **1st Data preprocessing**  
- Dropping missing and duplicate values
- Changing data type
- Feature engineering: separates time series into time durations (morning, afternoon, and night), and days of the week.
- Standardization

3. **Unsupervised method (DBSCAN)**  
   DBSCAN helps identify unusual patterns in water usage data by assigning data to different clusters based on their similarity and finding out the noise in the data.

4. **2nd Data preprocessing**  
- Identified outliers to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors within the same cluster. 
- Manually label the outliers and class = -1 (noise class classified by DBSCAN) as Anomaly =1 
- Split data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets, adjusting class weights for data imbalance.

5. **Supervised method (LSTM)**
   LSTMs is used for analyzing time-series data over time, learning  features of normal and anomalous readings, and providing a likelihood of abnormal usage on the test set.

6. **Evaluation**
- A threshold was chosen to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. 
- Given a confusion matrix and performance metrics (F1 score, recall rate, precision, and accuracy) based on the selected threshold.

### Results Summary

**Threshold**: 0.09
**Accuracy**: 0.7343713270371548
**Precision**: 0.0937579617834395
**Recall**: 0.22807561202355128
**F1 Score**: 0.13288796605579128

The higher recall rate suggests that the model predicted many anomaly readings. However, due to the low precision, the F1 score might not be high.
Low precision and high FP indicate that many normal usages were incorrectly identified as anomalies. However, due to the objective of identifying and predicting anomalous water usage, the main focus was on reducing the misrecognition of true anomaly data and increasing the number of true anomaly data that are recognized. Therefore, the higher recall rate allows for higher sensitivity to anomalies, which could be useful in alerting users to potential water usage issues. 

Future improvements could include more robust labeling techniques and better feature engineering.
